# Base64 Image Storage Setup

## Overview
This app now stores pizza images as Base64 encoded strings directly in the MongoDB database. This approach is completely free and requires no external services.

## Features Implemented

✅ **Base64 Encoding**: Images are converted to Base64 strings before storage
✅ **Image Compression**: Images are automatically compressed to reduce database size
✅ **Size Validation**: Images are limited to 5MB for reasonable performance
✅ **Type Validation**: Only image files are accepted
✅ **Fallback Images**: Default pizza image shown if no custom image is uploaded
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling for conversion failures

## How It Works

1. **Image Upload**: User selects an image file
2. **Compression**: Image is automatically compressed (max 800px width, 80% quality)
3. **Base64 Conversion**: Compressed image is converted to Base64 string
4. **Database Storage**: Base64 string is saved in the pizza document
5. **Display**: Base64 string is used directly as the image `src`

## Database Schema

```javascript
image: {
  data: String,        // Base64 encoded image data
  filename: String,    // Original filename for reference
  mimetype: String,    // Image MIME type (image/jpeg, image/png, etc.)
}
```

## Benefits

- **100% Free**: No external services required
- **Self-Contained**: Everything stored in your database
- **Works Everywhere**: Compatible with any hosting platform
- **Simple**: No API keys or configuration needed
- **Automatic Compression**: Optimizes images for web display

## Considerations

- **Database Size**: Images increase database size (but with compression, this is manageable)
- **Query Performance**: Large Base64 strings can slow down queries (but not significantly for 20-50 images)
- **Transfer Speed**: Base64 data is sent with each API request (compressed images help mitigate this)

## File Size Limits

- **Maximum File Size**: 5MB per image
- **Automatic Compression**: Images are compressed to max 800px width at 80% quality
- **Typical Result**: Most images end up being 50-200KB after compression

## Usage

The system automatically handles all image processing. Admins simply:
1. Select an image file in the admin interface
2. The app handles compression, conversion, and storage
3. Images appear immediately in the customer menu

No additional setup or configuration required!
